This command will build and start all the services in the docker-compose.yml file, including:

1. **Kafka**: The event streaming platform that enables real-time delivery tracking.
2. **Consul**: The service registry for dynamic service discovery.
3. **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Handles routing and load balancing between services.
4. **Producer and Consumer Services**: Handle order events and delivery tracking.
5. **Frontend**: Provides the Angular UI to display the order status and driver locations.
